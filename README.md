# Renamer
This is a simple script I wrote to rename some files in my library. A lot of these media files that I have stored in my library have superfluous prefixes and suffixes. With this script you can remove these substrings and even add your own custom name to your list of files for better readability.
### Setup
This is just Jupyter notebook running Python 3 so it requires almost no setup. Run this on your own machine or open the file in [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com/)
#### Variables
These are the variable that you would have to modify

 - **path:** directory containing the files needed to edit.
 - **delete:** list of strings to remove from original file name.
