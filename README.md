# Renamer
This is a simple script I wrote to rename some files in my library. A lot of these media files that I have stored in my library have superfluous prefixes and suffixes. With this script you can remove these substrings and even add your own custom name to your list of files for better readability.
### Setup
This is just Jupyter notebook running Python 3 so it requires almost no setup. Run this on your own machine or open the file in [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com/)
